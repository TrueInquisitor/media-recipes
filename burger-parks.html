        <li>2 tsp turmeric powder</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Method</h2>
    <h3>Chili Method:</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>Start by sauteing 1 large white onion for 3 minutes, then add in crushed garlic, 2 tablespoons of chili powder, 1 teaspoon of cayenne powder, 1 teaspoon of sweet paprika, and 1 teaspoon of oregano. Mix to combine and saute for additional 1-2 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add 1lb of ground beef, breaking into small pieces and saute for 5-7 minutes or no longer pink.</li>
        <li>Add a 28oz can of crushed tomatoes along with ¼ cup of water. Mix to combine and bring to a bare simmer. Partially cover letting simmer over low heat for 60-90 minutes.</li>
        <li>After the chilis finished cooking, add kosher salt and freshly ground pepper to taste. Cover to keep warm until ready to use. Can be made 3 days in advance.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Cheese Sauce Method:</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>Toss 8 ounces of grated sharp cheddar cheese with 1 tablespoon of cornstarch. Into a small saucepot, add 1 can of evaporated milk and the cheddar cheese-cornstarch mixture. Optional, but you can add a dash or two of hot sauce.</li>
        <li>Mix until combined and cook over medium heat, stirring constantly, until it has thickened into a cheese sauce. Set aside and keep warm.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Onion Rings Method:</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>Start by slicing 2 large Spanish onions into thick slices. Separate them into rings and spread them out onto a parchment-lined baking sheet.</li>
        <li>Place into the freezer until frozen solid, at least 1 hour. Once frozen, place into a large bowl filled with tepid water.</li>
        <li>Once thawed, gently peel off the inner membrane of the onion. Place the membrane-less onions on a parchment-lined baking sheet.</li>
        <li>In a bowl, add 1 cup of cake flour, ½ cup of cornstarch, 1 teaspoon of baking powder, ½ teaspoon of baking soda, and an optional shake of paprika. Whisk until thoroughly combined.</li>
        <li>Combine ¾ cup of beer with ¼ cup of vodka in a measuring cup. Whisk the flour batter continuously while pouring in the beer and vodka mixture. You want the consistency of paint.</li>
        <li>On the stovetop, in a large pot heat 1 quart each of vegetable oil and peanut oil to 375°F.</li>
        <li>Once 375°F is reached, dip the onion rings into the beer batter (let the excess drip off) and carefully drop into the frying oil. Let fry for 1 minute per side.</li>
        <li>After finished frying, place the onion ring(s) onto a wire rack set on a rimmed baking sheet to cool. Season with kosher salt while still warm. Keep warm in a 200°F oven during final preparations.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Burger Method:</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>On a lightly oiled cast-iron skillet set over medium-high heat, quickly toast the top and bottom buns.</li>
        <li>Crank the heat up to high, add the three ⅓ pound patties to the pan. Season generously with kosher salt and freshly ground pepper. Allow the bottom to sear for 3-5 minutes until a deep crust forms and the burgers can lift freely off the cast iron. Place a small dimple in the middle of each patty to prevent the patties from puffing up.</li>
        <li>Flip and cook for an additional 2-3 minutes. Kill the heat while topping each patty with a slice of yellow American cheese, adding a dash of water to the pan and covering to melt the cheese.</li>
        <li>For assembly, place a squirt of ketchup on the bottom bun, a small piece of lettuce followed by the first burger and onion ring, and another squirt of ketchup. Repeat this process 2 more times. Top with a fried egg then place the top bun on.</li>
        <li>Add a generous amount of chili to the pile of plated fries followed by a heaping amount of cheese sauce. Enjoy.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Chris's Salad Dressing Method:</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>In a small bowl, combine the juices of 1 large lemon, equal parts high-quality olive oil, and 2 teaspoons of turmeric. Whisk together until thoroughly combined.</li>
        <li>Pour over the salad of choice. Enjoy.</li>
    </ol>
